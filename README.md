<P ALIGN=CENTER>A Face Recognition Model Which Can Differentiate Between Different Person.</P>


<P ALIGN=CENTER>

Tried to create the Face Detection Tool with #machinelearning from #opencv and # #Python using #Pycharm.

The tool identifies the face of your known friends in a group college or video snaps.

<p align="center">

<b><u> <h2 align="center"> What we can do with this? </h2></u> </b>
</p>

The face detection will have a huge advantage in our coming times.

1.In Schools or colleges We can have the attendance while entering the corridor only without following that old convention of calling names which waste plenty of time of our enthusiastic teachers.

2.In Hospital, After any accident person can be identified if just like adhaar government have our encrypted photographs of faces for security purposes and our immediate help.

3.In parks or public places, If a person having a criminal background will be identified out security system can easily identify and trace, so others can be safe and secure.
